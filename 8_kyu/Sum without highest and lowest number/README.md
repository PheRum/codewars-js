## Sum without highest and lowest number

https://www.codewars.com/kata/576b93db1129fcf2200001e6

Sum all the numbers of a given array ( cq. list ), except the highest and the lowest element ( by value, not by index! ).

The highest or lowest element respectively is a single element at each edge, even if there are more than one with the same value.

Mind the input validation.

**Example**

```
{ 6, 2, 1, 8, 10 } => 16
{ 1, 1, 11, 2, 3 } => 6
```
